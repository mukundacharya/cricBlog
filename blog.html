            <figcaption class="img-cpt">Sanju Samson, despite losing Ben Stokes, would be hoping his side capitalizes on
                the missing South African pace duo Â© BCCI</figcaption>
            <p class="art-cont">Ben Stokes will no longer be available for Rajasthan Royals this season. In their season
                opener against Punjab Kings, Royals' new captain Sanju Samson constantly sought Stokes's counsel on the
                field, feeding off the experience of the English all-rounder. Stokes even was seen having chats with
                Chetan Sakariya when the youngster had the ball in hand. His broken finger therefore comes as a big blow
                not just for Rajasthan, but Samson too, which could be why Stokes will continue to stay on in India
                despite the injury.<br /><br />

                After their opening game heartbreak, Samson will now have to try and outwit last season's finalists
                Delhi Capitals, who despite missing mainstays like Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje and Axar Patel, put away
                Chennai Super Kings rather comfortably. However, they too have been hit with a snag leading into the
                contest, once again levelling the playing field. The Capitals would've hoped to bring in their South
                African pace duo, but COVID-related logistical issues have rendered them unavailable - something the
                Royals would love to capitalise on.<br /><br />
                "The feeling in the squad is really good. We're all eager to get back on the pitch and do well. We
                played well in the last game and unfortunately didn't quite get over the line. I think it's important
                for us to follow the process and take it game by game. Important to focus on what our job is, that is to
                express ourselves and play the brand of cricket we want to play. I believe we have a strong squad that
                is capable of producing the right results in different situations." - Sanju Samson.<br><br>

            <p class="auth">By Author on Wed, Apr 14, 2021, 05:25 PM</p>

            <figcaption class="img-cpt">Heath Streak was in violation of ICC's anti-corruption code during his tenure as
                Zimbabwe coach from 2016 to 2018</figcaption>
            <p class="art-cont">Former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak has been handed an eight-year ban from all cricket
                for breaching ICC's Anti-Corruption Code. The 47-year-old accepted five charges levelled against him for
                his role as the coach of Zimbabwe between 2016-2018 and as the coach of various franchises, including
                for the Kolkata Knight Riders during IPL 2018 and the Kabul Zwanan during APL 2018.<br /><br />
                During the Tribunal hearing, one of the factors that went in favour of Streak was that his offences did
                not affect the outcome of the relevant matches. Streak will be free to resume his involvement in the
                game on 28 March 2029.<br /><br />

                Streak's charges include "disclosing inside information...(that) may be used for betting purposes"
                during matches in the 2018 Tri-Series involving Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the Zimbabwe v
                Afghanistan series in 2018, the Indian Premier League 2018 and the Afghanistan Premier League 2018.
                Additionally, Streak was found to have "facilitated or attempted to facilitate the introduction of four
                different players, including a national captain" to someone who could have approached them to get
                insider information for betting purposes.<br /><br />
                The trouble for Streak traces back to September 2017, when he started a WhatsApp conversation with an
                Indian gentleman Mr X (identity redacted by ICC) who was interested in organizing a T20 league in
                Zimbabwe. The ICC reveals that Mr X had come out clean to Streak about his betting links and also
                requested his bank account outside Zimbabwe. The conversations between the two lasted for 15 months, the
                period during which he's been 12345 found guilty of breaching ICC's Anti-Corruption Code.<br><br>

            <p class="art-cont">CricBlog understands that South African pacer Anrich Nortje tested negative on arrival
                but later tested positive and negative thereafter. He's asymptomatic at the moment with results of a
                further test awaited today. Nortje has been in quarantine during these developments, and was to join the
                team bubble after the test results today.<br /><br />

                Nortje's situation is another scare for  Capitals to handle after the positive result of Axar Patel.
                Nortje, who flew in to India along with fellow paceman Kagiso Rabada, joins a growing list of Covid-19
                concerns in the IPL 2021.<br /><br />

                Apart from DC all-rounder Axar, Mumbai Indians' scout and wicketkeeping consultant Kiran More, as well
                as RCB's Daniel Sams and Devdutt Paddikal had tested positive. However, Padikkal has since linked up
                with the squad in Chennai after a negative COVID-19 result.<br /><br />

            <p class="art-cont">Rajasthan Royals all-rounder Ben Stokes has been ruled out of IPL 2021 after picking up
                a finger injury in the team's tournament opener against Punjab Kings on April 12. Stokes is understood
                to have broken his index finger on the left hand while taking a tumbling catch to dismiss Chris Gayle
                off the bowling of Riyan Parag.<br /><br />

                The development is a significant setback for the Royals, who are hoping to improve on an eighth place
                finish last season. They're already missing the services of Jofra Archer to a hand injury and even
                though the fast bowler has resumed light training, it is uncertain when he'll be cleared to resume
                playing and can join the team bubble in India.<br /><br />

                Stokes, who also missed out six games of last season's league phase after he'd travelled to New Zealand
                to be with his ailing father, will stay with the group in India "to provide his valued support and
                inputs off the field."<br /><br />

                David Miller and Liam Livingstone are the backup overseas batsmen in the Royals squad. The franchise
                confirmed that they were reviewing potential candidates to replace the England star.<br /><br />

                The Royals, who lost their opening encounter to the Punjab Kings, take on the Delhi Capitals on Thursday
                (April 15) in their next encounter.<br><br>
